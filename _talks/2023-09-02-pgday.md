I recently delivered a talk at the PGDAY event in Florianópolis, SC, Brazil, focused on using Patroni for high availability deployments. The session aimed to educate attendees on the implementation and benefits of Patroni in ensuring high availability for PostgreSQL databases.

During the talk, I covered the architecture of Patroni, its key features, and how it can be used to achieve robust and resilient database deployments. Practical examples and real-world scenarios were shared to demonstrate how Patroni can be effectively utilized to maintain database uptime and reliability.

Attendees gained insights into the configuration and management of Patroni clusters, best practices for deployment, and strategies for monitoring and maintaining high availability in PostgreSQL environments. The session was well-received, with participants appreciating the detailed explanations and practical tips on leveraging Patroni for their own high availability needs.
