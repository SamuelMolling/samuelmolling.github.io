I recently delivered a talk at the Tech Connection community event in Balneário Camboriú, SC, Brazil, focused on building indexes, query insights, and using Atlas Search with MongoDB. The session aimed to educate the community on the various types of indexes in MongoDB, their benefits, and practical use cases for each.

I discussed query insights, sharing best practices and real-world examples to optimize query performance. Additionally, I demonstrated how to leverage MongoDB's Atlas Search to enhance search capabilities within applications. The talk included practical use cases, illustrating how these features can be implemented to improve overall database performance and efficiency.

The audience gained practical knowledge on tools and methods to monitor and tune database performance, leading to faster query execution times and more efficient operations. The session was well-received, with participants appreciating the actionable tips and clear, hands-on approach to solving complex query performance issues.
