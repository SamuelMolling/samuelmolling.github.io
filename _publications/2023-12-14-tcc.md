I am thrilled to share the completion of my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Engineering! I developed DB Advisor, a system using AI and LLAMA2, a large language model (LLM), to recommend the best databases based on various criteria. This project highlights:

- Advanced AI algorithms for analysis and recommendation.
- Practical application of computer engineering principles.
